(Gaming based social media)

Fullstack web application with JavaScript technologies.

The idea is to develop two backends with Express.js integrated with a MySQL and a MongoDB database, while also using an ORM. Currently only know Sequelize.

Then develop the frontend with React and use some state management library more complete than Context, like Redux.

Eventually also deploy the application. Still need to learn more about this.
